# üêß My Linux Notes

This repository contains my personal notes on Linux, documented as I learn and practice various commands, system administration tasks, and concepts. These notes are a work in progress and will be updated regularly as I delve deeper into more topics.

### üéØ Purpose

-   **To document my learning journey:** A chronological record of my progress, from the basics to more advanced concepts.
-   **To have a quick reference for revision:** A personal knowledge base for quickly looking up commands, configurations, and workflows.
-   **To share knowledge:** To provide a resource for others who are also learning Linux.

### üìÇ Contents

#### Linux Fundamentals

* **What is Linux?** Linux is based on the **UNIX** operating system, a powerful, multi-user, and multitasking OS. Linux is free and open-source, promoting global collaboration and innovation because its source code can be inspected and modified by anyone.
* **Linux Distributions:** A Linux distribution is an operating system made up of a collection of software based on the Linux kernel. Examples include Ubuntu, Fedora, and Red Hat.

#### Architecture

The architecture of Linux is composed of several layers that interact to manage the system. 

* **Hardware:** The physical components of the computer.
* **Kernel:** The core of the Linux operating system. It virtualizes common hardware resources, making it seem as if a process is the only one running on the machine.
* **Shell:** The user interface that acts as a bridge between the user and the kernel, interpreting and executing commands.
* **Utilities:** Essential tools and programs for system management and configuration.
* **Applications:** The software programs used by the user.

#### File System

In Linux, everything is a file. Files are stored in a single-rooted, inverted tree-like structure called the **file system hierarchy**. The root directory, represented by a forward slash `/`, is the top-level directory.

#### Command Reference

This section provides a quick reference for common Linux commands.

* **File & Directory Commands**
    * `ls`: Lists files and directories.
    * `cd`: Changes the current directory.
    * `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.
    * `mkdir`: Creates a new directory.
    * `rm`: Removes files and directories.
    * `cp`: Copies files and directories.
    * `mv`: Moves or renames files and directories.
    * `touch`: Creates an empty file or updates a file's timestamp.
    * `cat`: Views the contents of a file.
    * `grep`: Searches for specific patterns or expressions in text files.

* **Process & System Management**
    * `ps`: Displays running processes.
    * `top`: Monitors system processes in real-time.
    * `kill`: Terminates a process using its Process ID (PID).
    * `chmod`: Changes file permissions.
    * `chown`: Changes file ownership.
    * `chgrp`: Changes group ownership of a file.

* **Networking**
    * `ifconfig`: Displays network interface information.
    * `ping`: Sends ICMP echo requests to a host to check connectivity.
    * `ssh`: Securely connects to a remote server.
    * `scp`: Securely copies files between hosts.
    * `wget`: Downloads files from the web.
    * `curl`: Transfers data to or from a server.
